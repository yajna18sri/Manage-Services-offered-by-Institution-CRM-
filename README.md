# A CRM Application to Manage the Services offered by an Institution
Problem Statement
Institutions often provide a wide range of services to students, staff, and external stakeholders. However, managing these services manually or through disconnected systems leads to challenges such as inefficient tracking, poor communication, lack of transparency, and difficulty in maintaining service records. This results in delays, reduced satisfaction, and limited insights for decision-making.

A Customer Relationship Management (CRM) application is required to streamline the management of services offered by the institution. The system should enable centralized service requests, automated tracking, structured communication, and reporting dashboards. By integrating all service-related activities into a single platform, the CRM will enhance efficiency, improve user experience, and support administrators in making data-driven decisions for continuous improvement.
